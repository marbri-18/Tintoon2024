# Tintoon2024
Project to style a home page of a web-site using CSS and Bootstrap.

This was a project that was part of the London App Brewery - Web Development 2024 course on Udemy. This was the project outcome of Section 11 of the course which featured styling a web-site homepage using CSS and Bootstrap. I also completed this project in an earlier version of this course in 2021. There is another repository on Github where the outcome of this project is available.
When completing this project in 2024, I was keen to retain some of the elements of my 2021 project. This included the alternating background colours of sections of the web-site, the carousel and my own illustrations of Looney Tunes and Wacky Races characters I had used in 2021.
